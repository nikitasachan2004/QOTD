# 🎯 Objective

Design and implement a clean, engaging, and responsive QOTD page that:

- Encourages students to solve one coding problem daily
- Provides a focused coding environment
- Shows progress and motivation signals
- Demonstrates strong frontend architecture and UI/UX skills

Target users: **DSA learners aged 18–24**

# 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React (Vite)** — component-based architecture
- **Tailwind CSS** — utility-first styling system
- **Framer Motion** — subtle UI animations
- **Lucide React Icons** — consistent icon system
- **Netlify** — deployment & CI build

# 🧱 Page Structure & Layout Decisions

The layout is designed with **user intent priority**:

## 1️⃣ Header
- Identity + daily challenge branding
- Level and streak indicators
- Profile menu with actions
- Quick recognition + personalization

## 2️⃣ Hero Section
- Clear “Question of the Day” focus
- Motivation subtitle
- Day & date placement for daily ritual effect
- Personal performance stats cards

## 3️⃣ Question Card
- Title + difficulty
- Metadata strip (topic, time, XP, lock)
- Improves scanability and preparation

## 4️⃣ Code Editor Area (Primary Focus Zone)
- Large default working space
- Language selector
- Run + Submit CTAs
- Dynamic editor resizing after execution
- Mock multi-language templates for visual realism

## 5️⃣ Result & Test Case Panel
- Appears after run/submit
- Clear pass indicators
- Performance stats cards

## 6️⃣ Supporting Sections
- Leaderboard
- Hint system
- Subscribe / notify CTA

# 🎨 UI/UX Design Principles Used

- **Monotone blue theme** → trust + focus
- **Strong visual hierarchy** → title → problem → code → result
- **Card-based layout** → cognitive separation
- **Micro-interactions** → hover, press, reveal
- **Progress signals** → streak, level, success rate
- **Habit triggers** → daily framing + date display
- **Low distraction coding zone**

---

# ⚡ Interactive Features

- Language dropdown with mock code template switching
- Dynamic editor height:
  - Large before execution
  - Shrinks after Run / Submit
- Animated result reveal
- Profile dropdown menu
- Hint reveal interaction
- Responsive layout behavior

---

# 📱 Responsiveness

Mobile-first adjustments:

- Sections stack vertically
- Buttons expand full width
- Cards reflow cleanly
- No horizontal overflow
- Editor remains usable

Tested across desktop and mobile breakpoints.

---

# ♿ Accessibility Considerations

- Focus-visible rings on buttons
- aria-labels on controls
- Keyboard-friendly dropdowns
- Color contrast safe ranges
- Icon + text pairing for clarity

---

# 📊 How This Design Encourages Daily Engagement

- Shows streak & level → progress psychology
- Displays day & date → daily ritual cue
- Single clear primary task → low overwhelm
- Immediate feedback → reward loop
- Stats & leaderboard → social motivation
- Reminder CTA → habit reinforcement

# 🧪 Mock vs Real Execution Note

Code execution and compilation are mocked intentionally.  
This task focuses on **frontend UX & UI engineering**, not backend judge systems.  
Language switching updates editor templates visually to simulate multi-language support.
